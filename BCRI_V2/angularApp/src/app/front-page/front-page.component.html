            <dt>Expected Points (EP)</dt>
            <dd>- assumes that not all yard lines are created equal. In other words, each yardline is assigned a point value and measures the number of points that would be expected to be scored based on down, distance, and field position. A negative value means that the opposing team would be expected to score the next points in the game.</dd>
            <dt>Expected Points Added (EPA)</dt>
            <dd>- uses Expected Points to measure the outcome of a play. It takes the EP value from the beginning of a play (e.g. 2nd and 5 at the 50) and subtracts it from the EP value resulting from the play (e.g. rush for 10 yards results in 1st and 10 from the 40).</dd>
            
            <dt>Success Rate</dt>
            <dd>- an efficiency metric that determines the success of a play. Successful plays meet one of the following criteria:
              <div class="customContainer">
                <ul>
                  <li>the offense scored.</li>
                  <li>1st downs which gain at least 50% of the yards to go.</li>
                  <li>2nd downs which gain at least 70% of the yards to go.</li>
                  <li>3rd and 4th downs which gain at least 100% of the yards to go.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </dd>
            <dt>Power Success</dt>
            <dd>- measures the percentage of running plays on 3rd or 4th down from 2 yards or less in which the offense either converted into a 1st down or scored a TD. 1st and 2nd down and goal plays within the 2 yard line are also included.</dd>
            <dt>Stuff Rate</dt>
            <dd>- is the percentage of running plays stopped at or behind the line of scrimmage.</dd>
            <dt>Explosiveness</dt>
            <dd>- measures the average EPA on plays which were marked as successful.</dd>
            <dt>Havoc</dt>
            <dd>- refers to the percentage of plays in which the defense recorded a TFL, forced a fumble, intercepted a pass, or recorded a PBU.</dd>
            <dt>Havoc - DB</dt>
            <dd>- the percentage of plays in which the defense intercepted a pass or recorded a PBU.</dd>
            <dt>Havoc - Front 7</dt>
            <dd>- the percentage of plays in which the defense forced a fumble or recorded a TFL.</dd>
            <dt>Line Yards</dt>
            <dd>- attempts to measure the number of running yards which are attributed to the offensive line. Yards are weighted as follows:
              <div class="customContainer"> 
                <ul>
                  <li>losses - 120%</li>
                  <li>0-4 yards from LOS - 100%</li>
                  <li>5-10 yards from LOS - 50%</li>
                  <li>11+ yards from LOS - 0%</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </dd>
            <dt>Second Level Yards</dt>
            <dd>- measures the average yards per carry that are between 5 and 10 yards from the LOS.</dd>
            <dt>Open Field Yards</dt>
            <dd>- measures the average yards per carry that comes from over 10 yards past the LOS.</dd>
            <dt>Average Field Position Start (Avg FP Start)</dt>
            <dd>- refers to the average starting field position in yards away from the opponents goal line.</dd>
            <dt>Points Per Opportunity</dt>
            <dd>- simple average of points scored per opportunity with the ball.</dd>
